This project was done as a part of the university capstone project of data mining subject.

Abstract
The purpose of this project was to predict energy consumption using the data of Finland's transmission system operator. The objective of this project was to test if a machine learning model can yield good enough results in a complex forecasting problem, exploring machine learning techniques and developing a data-driven model for forecasting energy. We used a long-short-term memory (LSTM) model to train the data. The model was evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE) to be directly comparable to energy readings in the data. The result shows that electricity consumption can be predicted using machine-learning algorithms Keywords: Machine Learning, Energy Consumption Prediction, Time Series Forecasting, Long-Short Term Memory.
